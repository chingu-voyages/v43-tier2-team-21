Your project's `readme` is as important to success as your code. For 
this reason you should put as much care into its creation and maintenance
as you would any other component of the application.

If you are unsure of what should go into the `readme` let this article,
written by an experienced Chingu, be your starting point -

And before we go there's "one more thing"! Once you decide what to include
in your `readme` feel free to replace the text we've provided here.
